2. ✅ Ensure MongoDB is running
3. ✅ Verify database and collection names
4. ✅ Restart the application
5. ✅ Test with a player query

### Short Term (Recommended)
1. Add MongoDB indexes for better performance:
   ```javascript
   db.getCollection('IPL-ALL').createIndex({ batter: 1 })
   db.getCollection('IPL-ALL').createIndex({ ID: 1, innings: 1 })
   ```

2. Explore different players and scenarios
3. Try various ball counts and over ranges
4. Compare multiple players manually

### Long Term (Optional)
1. Customize the UI colors/theme
2. Add more analysis types
3. Integrate with external APIs
4. Deploy to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
5. Add authentication if needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues
See **MONGODB_SETUP.md** for detailed help

### Port Already in Use
Change PORT in `.env` or kill the process:
```bash
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill
```

### No Players Showing
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify collection name
- Check `batter` field exists

### Charts Not Displaying
- Ensure data is being returned from API
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Recharts is installed
